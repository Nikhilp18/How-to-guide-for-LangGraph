📘 LangGraph Guide

This repository is a hands-on guide to building conversational agents using LangGraph, a powerful library for creating stateful, multi-step LLM applications with graph-based logic. It includes progressively advanced examples that demonstrate how to construct intelligent workflows for chat and retrieval tasks.

📂 What's Inside
🗨️ Basic Chatbot
A simple LangGraph-powered chatbot that maintains context across user interactions.

🔄 Programmatic Chat
Introduces conditional logic using LLM-driven checks, enabling dynamic branching and task execution based on user input.

📚 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Implements a basic RAG setup to enhance responses with relevant external documents.

🤖 RAG-based Chatbot
A conversational agent that combines LangGraph's workflow capabilities with RAG for context-aware, document-grounded interactions.
